                              =========

A Tcl binding for the ImageMagick image manipulation library.

Originally by Rolf Schroedter <Rolf.Schroedter@dlr.de>

Updates, new commands and Tk connector by David N. Welton
<davidw@dedasys.com>

Subsequent work has been done by Massimo Manghi
<massimo.manghi@unipr.it>, and Bob Friesenhahn
<bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>.

The Unix/Linux build is currently done using Automake+libtool. The
quality of the integration as pertains to Tcl would be improved if the
TclMagick build is changed to a pure Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA)
build and test framework similar to SampleExtension
(https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/SampleExtension).
